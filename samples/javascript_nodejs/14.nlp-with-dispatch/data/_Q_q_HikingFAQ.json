      "answer": "[Footwear](https://www.rei.com/c/hiking-footwear) is one of the most important items you need to choose, and it’s a very personal choice. Some hikers prefer supportive over-the-ankle boots, while others enjoy lightweight [trail-running shoes](https://www.rei.com/c/trail-running-shoes). The terrain you’ll be walking on can also affect your decision. Lightweight, low-cut [hiking shoes](https://www.rei.com/c/hiking-shoes) may be fine on well-maintained trails without a lot of obstacles, whereas [sturdy boots](https://www.rei.com/c/hiking-boots) may serve you better on a rugged trail with rocks, roots and streams.",
